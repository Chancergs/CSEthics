    //Game Notes:

    //Game will start on Day 1. Every Day you will be able to do a certain amount of things.
    //Once you have decided which things to do, you press a "Run" button.
    //You'll get income from your produced malware, along with a risk check that has a chance to proc negative events.
    //Currently, the goal of the game will be to reach a certain amount of money by a certain time, maybe to pay off outrageous student loans or something.
    //Different types of malware will have different risk increase amounts, and provide different amounts of money.
    //A part of the GUI near the malware selection will be an information button. Upon clicked, it will tell you a little about the type of malware, and famous incidents involving the type.
    //There will probably also be special actions you can take when you have certain amounts of things, such as DDoS attacks using trojan created zombies.
