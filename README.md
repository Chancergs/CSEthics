# CSEthics


This is the github for my program for the final in CSCI_215. A lot of the files in here are just netbeans stuff.
The actual .java files are under the src/csethics folder.


This is a game about malware. 

It's really simply mechanic wise and GUI wise, however it is kind of neat.

THe goal is to earn money through malware based income before a certain number of days have passed. Producing malware contributes to a risk percentage. If the risk percentage is triggered, it can cause a risk event. Risk events can do anything from making you lose a single worm, or completely ending the game.

The game is probably not very balanced, and I didn't get all the actual information I wanted in there, but I had some fun making it.
